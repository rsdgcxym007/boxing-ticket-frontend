# WebSocket Listener Optimization Summary

## Issue Identified
The WebSocket listeners were being set up multiple times, causing performance issues and redundant event handling. This happened because:

1. `setupWebSocketListeners()` was called in `initializeBookingSystem()` 
2. `setupWebSocketListeners()` was also called in `fetchSeats(true)` when skipping initialization
3. Every time a WebSocket event triggered `handleSeatUpdateFromOthers()`, it would call `fetchSeats(true)`, which would set up new listeners

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Listener Management Flag
- Introduced `listenersSetup` ref to track whether WebSocket listeners have been configured
- Prevents redundant listener setup with early return when already configured

### 2. Removed Redundant Listener Setup
- Removed the extra `setupWebSocketListeners()` call from `fetchSeats()` when skipping initialization
- Now listeners are only set up once during the booking system initialization

### 3. Enhanced WebSocket Composable
- Added proper listener cleanup with `off()` and `offAny()` before setting up new listeners
- Prevents accumulation of duplicate event handlers

### 4. Added Cleanup on Modal Close
- Reset `listenersSetup` flag when modal closes or unmounts
- Ensures fresh listener setup when modal reopens

## Key Changes Made

### `/components/ModalStadiumZoneSelector.vue`
```javascript
// Added listener management flag
const listenersSetup = ref(false);

// Enhanced setupWebSocketListeners with redundancy prevention
const setupWebSocketListeners = () => {
  if (listenersSetup.value) {
    console.log("🔗 WebSocket listeners ถูกตั้งค่าไว้แล้ว, ข้าม...");
    return;
  }
  // ... setup logic
  listenersSetup.value = true;
};

// Removed redundant listener setup from fetchSeats
// Added cleanup in resetAndClose, onCloseSummaryModal, and onBeforeUnmount
```

### `/composables/useWebSocket.ts`
```javascript
// Enhanced onSeatUpdate with proper cleanup
const onSeatUpdate = (callback: (event: any) => void) => {
  // Remove old listeners first
  eventTypes.forEach(eventType => {
    socketInstance.off(eventType);
  });
  socketInstance.offAny();
  
  // Set up new listeners
  // ... setup logic
};
```

## Expected Benefits

1. **Performance**: Eliminates redundant event listeners and reduces memory usage
2. **Reliability**: Prevents duplicate event handling that could cause UI inconsistencies
3. **Maintainability**: Cleaner listener lifecycle management
4. **Debugging**: Clearer logs showing when listeners are actually set up vs skipped

## Testing Recommendations

1. Open the seat selection modal and verify listeners are set up only once
2. Perform seat selections and verify events are handled correctly without duplicates
3. Test with multiple users to ensure real-time updates work properly
4. Check browser console for reduced redundant log messages
5. Verify modal close/reopen cycles work correctly

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

The redundant WebSocket listener issue has been resolved. The system now properly manages listener lifecycle and should provide improved performance and reliability for real-time seat updates.
