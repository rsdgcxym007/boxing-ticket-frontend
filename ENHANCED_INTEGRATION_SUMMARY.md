# Enhanced Booking System Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Enhanced Booking System into `ModalStadiumZoneSelector.vue` and `SummaryModal.vue` components with complete real-time functionality, seat locking, and concurrency protection.

## Components Updated

### 1. ModalStadiumZoneSelector.vue ✅
**Key Integrations:**
- **Real-time WebSocket Connection**: Shows connection status indicator
- **Enhanced Seat Management**: Uses `useSeatManager` for seat state and locking
- **Automatic Seat Locking**: Seats are automatically locked when selected
- **Concurrency Protection**: Prevents double-booking with enhanced order system
- **Visual Feedback**: Added loading states and connection indicators
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for seat conflicts

**New Features:**
- Connection status indicator (green/red dot)
- Seat locking visual indicator (orange color)
- Enhanced loading states with spinners
- Automatic seat unlocking on modal close
- System health monitoring integration

### 2. SummaryModal.vue ✅
**Key Integrations:**
- **Enhanced Order Creation**: Uses `createOrderWithProtection` instead of direct API calls
- **Real-time System Health**: Shows system status warnings
- **Seat Lock Management**: Properly cancels seat selections on close
- **Concurrency Protection**: Prevents multiple simultaneous submissions
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages and retry logic

**New Features:**
- System health status indicator
- Enhanced loading states with progress indicators
- Automatic seat unlock on cancellation
- Better error categorization (seat conflict, timeout, etc.)

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Composables Integration
```javascript
// Both components now use:
- useTicketBookingManager() // Main orchestrator
- useSeatManager() // Seat state management
- useWebSocket() // Real-time events
- useEnhancedOrderSystem() // Seat locking/unlocking
```

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Real-time Seat Updates
- WebSocket connection for live seat status
- Automatic seat availability refresh
- Real-time lock/unlock notifications

#### 2. Seat Locking System
- Automatic 4-minute seat locks when selected
- Visual feedback for locked seats
- Auto-unlock on modal close or timeout

#### 3. Concurrency Protection
- Prevents double-booking through enhanced order system
- Race condition handling
- Proper error recovery

#### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Loading states with spinners
- Connection status indicators
- Clear error messages
- Automatic retry logic

### Error Handling Improvements

#### ModalStadiumZoneSelector.vue
- **409 (Conflict)**: Seat already booked → refresh seat data
- **429 (Rate Limit)**: Too many requests → retry guidance
- **Generic**: Fallback error handling

#### SummaryModal.vue
- **Seat Conflicts**: Specific seat booking error messages
- **Timeout**: Session timeout handling
- **System Health**: System status warnings

## User Interface Enhancements

### Visual Indicators
1. **Connection Status**: Green/red dot showing WebSocket connection
2. **Seat States**: 
   - Available (gray armchair)
   - Selected (green seat)
   - Locked (orange square)

## Usage Example

```vue
<!-- Enhanced booking flow -->
<template>
  <ModalStadiumZoneSelector
    :isOpen="showModal"
    :zoneKey="selectedZone"
    :mode="bookingMode"
    @close="closeModal"
  />
</template>

<script>
// Automatically includes:
// - Real-time seat updates
// - Seat locking protection
